# Tools for lazy people

## Purpose

I got tired of losing scripts I wrote and kept rewriting over and over again. This repository is a dumping ground for those things. Nothing comes with a gaurantee and a majority is going to be things bodged together with duct tape and discarded man pages. I'll do my best to keep things updated and feel free to hack away on anything if you think you can make it less trash.

## Active Projects

Haha, there are none. Everything is just made and thrown in to this trash heap and forgotten about. Trust nothing. Just look at my commit history if you want to know what I care about.

I'm sure GitHub has a better way to track projects but I'm a lazy person and haven't figured it out yet.

Any other script I have here is just a dumped script that I might need or that I took from somewhere else. If you have any questions you probably know me as a person so contact me via the channels you know how to contact me by.
